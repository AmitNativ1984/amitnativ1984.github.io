1. Launch turtlebot with gazebo:
```
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py
```

2. Launch Turtule bot with a saved map:
```
ros2 launch turtlebot3_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py map:=<path_to_map.yaml> use_sim_time:=True
```

## 1. GLOBAL PLANNER, CONTROLLER (LOCAL PLANNER), COSTMAPS
### 1.1. Global Planner
- Global planner is responsible to a global, long distance path from an initial position to goal.
- To Generate a path, the global planner needs two things:
    - A Map of the environment: Each cell is a binary represention if the cell it occupied or not. (occupied = 1, free = 0)
     

    - A cost map:
        A cost map assigns a cost to each pixel (cell) of the map. The cost is a value that represents how difficult is to navigate throught that cell.


    By summing these two maps, we generate a global cost map. The global planner uses this global cost map to generate a path from the initial position to the goal.

### 1.2 CONTROLLER (LOCAL PLANNER)
- The global planner generates a path from the initial position to the goal. The controller is responsible to follow this path. In other words, it is responsible to generate the velocity commands to the robot to follow the path. The update of the local planner is much faster relative to the global planner.

In reference to driving a car, the global planner is equivilant to the GPS, and the local planner is equivilant to the steering wheel, accelrating and applying the brakes according to actual situation on the road.

- To improve efficiency, the local planner analyzes a much smaller map. This map is called the local cost map. It is centered on the robot position.

In the following image the local cost map is visible, along with the local path generated by the local planner.
